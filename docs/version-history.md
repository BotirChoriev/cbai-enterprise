# CBAI Version History

This tracks major capability milestones, not individual commits — see `docs/build-ledger.md`
for the commit-level breakdown and `git log` for the full record.

## v0 — Catalog foundation

Static `ResearchTopic` catalog (65 topics across 10 domains), topic detail pages, global
research network graph, research workspace explorer. No decision support — display only.

## v1 — Deterministic Intelligence Engines

Gap Engine → Decision Engine → Readiness Engine → Health Engine → Workflow Engine, each strictly
consuming the one below it. Zero AI, zero invented scores or percentages, zero fabricated
evidence. Every state that can't currently be derived honestly renders as an explicit "Unknown"
or empty state rather than a guess.

## v1.1 — Research Cockpit

One operational surface per topic (Mission, Current Stage, Research Health, Research Readiness,
Current Workflow, Recommended Next Action with a real link, Blocking Factors, Latest Research
Activity) — replacing several smaller, overlapping cards.

## v2 — Universal product identity (EPIC-01)

Public entry experience rewritten to present CBAI as a universal Intelligence Operating System
with three named ecosystems (Research — flagship, Governance, Economic) sharing one Intelligence
Core, rather than a country/company/university search tool.

## v2.1 — Universal Intelligence Foundation (EPIC-02)

`lib/foundation/` — ten domain-agnostic pillars (Subject, Mission, Question, Evidence,
Relationship, Analysis, Recommendation, Execution, Timeline, Knowledge) that every future
ecosystem is expected to express its concepts through. Research Intelligence is the first,
and so far only, real consumer, via `lib/foundation/adapters/research-foundation-adapter.ts`.
No existing engine was rewritten; the Foundation was proven compatible with Research
Intelligence's real, already-shipped output through pure translation functions, verified by
TypeScript's structural type-checking at build time.

## v2.2 — Universal Relationship Engine (EPIC-03)

`lib/relationships/` — a builder (`buildRelationship`, with deterministic, evidence-count-based
confidence — never a fabricated score) and a query engine (subject lookup, type filtering,
connected-ID resolution, bounded one-hop traversal) over the Foundation's `Relationship` type,
now enriched with direction, strength, evidence, confidence, time, status, source, explanation,
and known limitations. Sixteen domain-agnostic relationship types defined and extensible.
Research Intelligence's catalog-derived relationships (method/evidence-type connections) now
flow through this builder instead of being constructed by hand.

This release also produced a significant audit finding: three separate, real graph/relationship
systems already exist in this repository (`lib/graph/`, `lib/research/graph/`, and a large,
entirely dormant `lib/intelligence/graph/`), none unified. This is the exact duplication problem
the Foundation and Relationship Engine exist to eventually solve — but migrating two live,
working routes (`/graph`, the research network) without a way to visually verify the result was
judged too risky for this Epic. Recorded as a deliberate scope decision, not an oversight — see
`docs/current-progress.md`.

## v2.3 — Universal Evidence Operating System (EPIC-04, this release)

`lib/evidence/` — a reusable Evidence Engine (`buildEvidence`, `validateEvidenceRecord`,
`linkSupportingEvidence`/`linkConflictingEvidence`, `appendEvidenceHistory`,
`findEvidenceForSubject`, `groupEvidenceBySourceType`, `groupEvidenceByVerificationStatus`,
`compareEvidence`, `traceEvidence`) over the Foundation's `Evidence` type, now enriched from 4
fields to 21: identity, original source, source type, origin organization, authors, publication
date, version, language, original language, verification status, reliability, confidence, known
limitations, supporting/conflicting evidence links, related subjects/missions/questions/
relationships, timeline, and an append-only history log. Every new field is optional, so every
existing Evidence record remains valid unmodified.

`EvidenceSourceType` and `VerificationStatus` were **promoted, not duplicated**, from two real,
pre-existing modules (`lib/research/evidence/evidence-types.ts` and
`lib/evidence-infrastructure/types.ts`), which now re-export the Foundation definitions as
zero-behavior-change aliases. `Confidence` was extracted out of EPIC-03's
`RelationshipConfidence` into a shared `lib/foundation/confidence.ts` so Evidence and
Relationship use one categorical vocabulary, not two independent ones. Research Intelligence's
catalog evidence now flows through `buildEvidence` instead of being constructed by hand, with an
honest (never-"verified") mapping from the catalog's coarse connection status to
`VerificationStatus`.

This release also produced an audit finding, following the same pattern as EPIC-03's graph
audit: a third, pre-existing "Evidence" concept exists in the large, mostly-dormant
`lib/intelligence/` subsystem, built on a numeric 0–100 `relevance` score. It was deliberately
**not** integrated — numeric scoring is philosophically incompatible with the categorical,
never-fabricated approach used everywhere else in the Foundation. Recorded as known technical
debt, not an oversight — see `docs/current-progress.md`.

## Planned (not started)

Governance Intelligence and Economic Intelligence ecosystems, each with their own foundation
adapter once real domain data exists to adapt. Consolidating `lib/graph/`, `lib/research/graph/`,
and `lib/intelligence/graph/` onto `lib/relationships/` once a visual verification workflow
exists to de-risk the migration. Unifying or retiring `lib/intelligence/evidence.types.ts`'s
numeric-scoring Evidence model. AI reasoning, Executive Briefing, Voice Intelligence,
Evidence-backed Recommendations, a rendered Timeline, a Knowledge Graph view, and Mission
Execution — the Evidence and Relationship shapes are architecturally ready for these, but no UI
or derivation logic exists yet. No target date is committed here — see
`docs/current-progress.md` for what's honestly available today.
